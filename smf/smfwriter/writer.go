// Write writes a midi message to the SMF file.
// Due to the nature of SMF files there is some maybe surprising behavior.
// - If the header has not been written yet, it will be written before writing the first message.
// - The first message will be written to track 0 which will be implicetly created.
// - All messages of a track will be buffered inside the track and only be written if an EndOfTrack
//   message is written.
// - The number of tracks that are written will never execeed the NumTracks that have been defined as
//   an option. If the last track has been written, io.EOF will be returned. (Also for any further attempt to write).
// - It is the responsability of the caller to make sure the provided NumTracks (which defaults to 1) is not
//   larger as the number of tracks in the file. smfreader is tolerant when reading such a file; so may be other
//   SMF readers.
// - It is the responsability of the caller to open and close any file where appropriate. The writer just uses an io.Writer.

// that have been physically written.

Depending upon the application you are using to create the file in the first place, header information may automatically be saved from within parameters set in the application, or may need to be placed in a ‘set-up’ bar before the music data commences.

Either way, information that should be considered includes:

GM/GS Reset message

Per MIDI Channel
Bank Select (0=GM) / Program Change #
Reset All Controllers (not all devices may recognize this command so you may prefer to zero out or reset individual controllers)
Initial Volume (CC7) (standard level = 100)
Expression (CC11) (initial level set to 127)
Hold pedal (0 = off)
Pan (Center = 64)
Modulation (0)
Pitch bend range
Reverb (0 = off)
Chorus level (0 = off)

System Exclusive data

If RPNs or more detailed controller messages are being employed in the file these should also be reset or normalized in the header.

If you are inputting header data yourself it is advisable not to clump all such information together but rather space it out in intervals of 5-10 ticks. Certainly if a file is designed to be looped, having too much data play simultaneously will cause most playback devices to ‘choke, ’ and throw off your timing.
