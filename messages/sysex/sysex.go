Universal System Exclusive ID Numbers

This includes the Non Real Time (7E) and Real Time (7F) ID extensions mentioned above in note 5.

The generalised format for both is as follows :
F0 <ID number> <Device ID> <Sub ID#1> <Sub ID#2> . . . . F7

The Device ID (also referred to as the channel number) is generally used to specify a discrete physical device, however complex devices (e.g. computers with a number of different MIDI expansion cards) may have more than one Device ID. A value of 7F is used to specify all devices.

From one to sixteen virtual devices may be accessed at each Device ID by use of the normal MIDI channel numbers, within the capabilities of the device.

The Non-Commercial Universal System Exclusive ID (7D) is not detailed here.

File Dump

This standard is similar to the Sample Dump Standard (SDS) but applies to file data rather than to sample data.

It comprises three similarly named messages (Dump Request, Dump Header and Data Packet), which as with the SDS are used in combination with the five Handshaking messages (EOF, ACK, NAK, Wait and Cancel) in accordance with the Dump Procedure.
File Dump Header

<data>	Data (encoded as below)
<checksum>	XOR of all bytes following the SOX up to the checksum byte
F7	EOX

Encoding of data :

The 8-bit file data needs to be converted to 7-bit form, with the result that every 7 bytes of file data translates to 8 bytes in the MIDI stream.

For each group of 7 bytes (of file data) the top bit from each is used to construct an eigth byte, which is sent first. So :
AAAAaaaa BBBBbbbb CCCCcccc DDDDdddd EEEEeeee FFFFffff GGGGgggg

becomes :
0ABCDEFG 0AAAaaaa 0BBBbbbb 0CCCcccc 0DDDdddd 0EEEeeee 0FFFffff 0GGGgggg

The final group may have less than 7 bytes, and is coded as follows (e.g. with 3 bytes in the final group) :
0ABC0000 0AAAaaaa 0BBBbbbb 0CCCcccc

MIDI Tuning Standard

This standard requires that each of the 128 MIDI note numbers can be tunable to any frequency within the instrument's range. Additionally it allows provision for up to 128 tuning programs.

An instrument which supports MIDI Tuning may have less than the full complement of tuning programs.

The specification provides a frequency resolution somewhat finer than one-hundredth of a cent, which should be fine enough for most needs. Instruments supporting MIDI Tuning need not necessarily provide this fine a resolution – the specification merely permits the transfer of tuning data at any resolution up to this limit.

See also the Real Time MIDI Tuning messages and Registered Parameter Numbers 3 (Select Tuning Program) and 4 (Select Tuning Bank).

F7	EOX

Frequency data :

The 3-byte frequency data has the following format :
0xxxxxxx 0abcdefg 0hijklmn

Where :
xxxxxxx = semitone (MIDI note number);
abcdefghijklmn = fraction of a semitone, in 0.0061 cent units.

The frequency range starts at MIDI note 0, C = 8.1758 Hz, and extends above MIDI note 127, G = 12543.875 Hz. The first byte of the frequency data word specifies the nearest equal-tempered semitone below the required frequency. The remaining two bytes specify the fraction of 100 cents above the semitone at which the required frequency lies.

The frequency data of 7F 7F 7F has special significance, and indicates a no change situation. I.e. when an instrument receives these 3 bytes as frequency data, it should make no change to its stored frequency data for that MIDI key number.

/*
	F0 <length> <bytes to be transmitted after F0>

	The length is stored as a variable-length quantity. It specifies the number of bytes which follow it, not
	including the F0 or the length itself. For instance, the transmitted message F0 43 12 00 07 F7 would be stored
	in a MIDI File as F0 05 43 12 00 07 F7. It is required to include the F7 at the end so that the reader of the
	MIDI File knows that it has read the entire message.
*/

/*
	   Another form of sysex event is provided which does not imply that an F0 should be transmitted. This may be
	   used as an "escape" to provide for the transmission of things which would not otherwise be legal, including
	   system realtime messages, song pointer or select, MIDI Time Code, etc. This uses the F7 code:

	   F7 <length> <all bytes to be transmitted>

	   Unfortunately, some synthesiser manufacturers specify that their system exclusive messages are to be
	   transmitted as little packets. Each packet is only part of an entire syntactical system exclusive message, but
	   the times they are transmitted are important. Examples of this are the bytes sent in a CZ patch dump, or the
	   FB-01's "system exclusive mode" in which microtonal data can be transmitted. The F0 and F7 sysex events
	   may be used together to break up syntactically complete system exclusive messages into timed packets.
	   An F0 sysex event is used for the first packet in a series -- it is a message in which the F0 should be
	   transmitted. An F7 sysex event is used for the remainder of the packets, which do not begin with F0. (Of
	   course, the F7 is not considered part of the system exclusive message).
	   A syntactic system exclusive message must always end with an F7, even if the real-life device didn't send one,
	   so that you know when you've reached the end of an entire sysex message without looking ahead to the next
	   event in the MIDI File. If it's stored in one complete F0 sysex event, the last byte must be an F7. There also
	   must not be any transmittable MIDI events in between the packets of a multi-packet system exclusive
	   message. This principle is illustrated in the paragraph below.

			Here is a MIDI File of a multi-packet system exclusive message: suppose the bytes F0 43 12 00 were to be
			sent, followed by a 200-tick delay, followed by the bytes 43 12 00 43 12 00, followed by a 100-tick delay,
			followed by the bytes 43 12 00 F7, this would be in the MIDI File:

			F0 03 43 12 00						|
			81 48											| 200-tick delta time
			F7 06 43 12 00 43 12 00   |
			64												| 100-tick delta time
			F7 04 43 12 00 F7         |

			When reading a MIDI File, and an F7 sysex event is encountered without a preceding F0 sysex event to start a
			multi-packet system exclusive message sequence, it should be presumed that the F7 event is being used as an
			"escape". In this case, it is not necessary that it end with an F7, unless it is desired that the F7 be transmitted.
*/

/*
			SysEx events

There are a couple of ways of encoding System Exclusive messages. The normal method is to encode them as a single event, though it is also possible to split messages into separate packets (continuation events). A third form (an escape sequence) is used to wrap up arbitrary bytes that could not otherwise be included in a MIDI file.
Single (complete) SysEx messages

F0 length message

length is a variable length quantity (as used to represent delta-times) which specifies the number of bytes in the following message.
message is the remainder of the system exclusive message, minus the initial 0xF0 status byte.

Thus, it is just like a normal system exclusive message, though with the additional length parameter.

Note that although the terminal 0xF7 is redundant (strictly speaking, due to the use of a length parameter) it must be included.
Example

The system exclusive message :
F0 7E 00 09 01 F7

would be encoded (without the preceding delta-time) as :
F0 05 7E 00 09 01 F7

(In case you're wondering, this is a General MIDI Enable message.)
SysEx messages sent as packets - Continuation events

Some older MIDI devices, with slow onboard processors, cannot cope with receiving a large amount of data en-masse, and require large system exclusive messages to be broken into smaller packets, interspersed with a pause to allow the receiving device to process a packet and be ready for the next one.

This approach can of course be used with the method described above, i.e. with each packet being a self-contained system exclusive message (i.e. each starting with 0xF0 and ending with 0xF7).

Unfortunately, some manufacturers (notably Casio) have chosen to bend the standard, and rather than sending the packets as self-contained system exclusive messages, they act as though running status applied to system exclusive messages (which it doesn't - or at least it shouldn't).

What Casio do is this : the first packet has an initial 0xF0 byte but doesn't have a terminal 0xF7. The last packet doesn't have an initial 0xF0 but does have a terminal 0xF7. All intermediary packets have neither. No unrelated events should occur between these packets. The idea is that all the packets can be stitched together at the receiving device to create a single system exclusive message.

Putting this into a MIDI file, the first packet uses the 0xF0 status, whereas the second and subsequent packets use the 0xF7 status. This use of the 0xF7 status is referred to as a continuation event.
Example

A 3-packet message :
F0 43 12 00
43 12 00 43 12 00
43 12 00 F7

with a 200-tick delay between the first two, and a 100-tick delay between the final two, would be encoded (without the initial delta-time, before the first packet) :
F0 03 43 12 00 	first packet (the 4 bytes F0,43,12,00 are transmitted)
81 48 	200-tick delta-time
F7 06 43 12 00 43 12 00 	second packet (the 6 bytes 43,12,00,43,12,00 are transmitted)
64 	100-tick delta-time
F7 04 43 12 00 F7 	third packet (the 4 bytes 43,12,00,F7 are transmitted)

See the note below regarding distinguishing packets and escape sequences (which both use the 0xF7 status).
Escape sequences

F7 length bytes

length is a variable length quantity which specifies the number of bytes in bytes.

This has nothing to do with System Exclusive messages as such, though it does use the 0xF7 status. It provides a way of including bytes that could not otherwise be included within a MIDI file, e.g. System Common and System Real Time messages (Song Position Pointer, MTC, etc).

Note that Escape sequences do not have a terminal 0xF7 byte.
Example

The Song Select System Common message :
F3 01

would be encoded (without the preceding delta-time) as :
F7 02 F3 01

You are not restricted to single messages per escape sequence - any arbitrary collection of bytes may be included in a single sequence.

Note Parsing the 0xF7 status byte

When an event with an 0xF7 status byte is encountered whilst reading a MIDI file, its interpretation (SysEx packet or escape sequence) is determined as follows :

    When an event with 0xF0 status but lacking a terminal 0xF7 is encountered, then this is the first of a Casio-style multi-packet message, and a flag (boolean variable) should be set to indicate this.

    If an event with 0xF7 status is encountered whilst this flag is set, then this is a continuation event (a system exclusive packet, one of many).
    If this event has a terminal 0xF7, then it is the last packet and flag should be cleared.

    If an event with 0xF7 status is encountered whilst flag is clear, then this event is an escape sequence.

Naturally, the flag should be initialised clear prior to reading each track of a MIDI file.
